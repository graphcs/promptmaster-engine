"""Flow Triggers — one-click advanced prompting techniques from the book.

Implements book concepts from Ch1 S13-S14 and Ch2 S15:
- Contradiction Prompts (Challenge This)
- Structured Self-Check (Self-Audit Response)
- Call Out Drift Directly (Drift Alert)
- Refinement Loops (Refine as... variants)
- Shadow Prompts (Check Intent)
- Reverse Q&A (Ask Questions)

Each trigger either:
  (a) builds a new prompt that runs through the full iteration pipeline
